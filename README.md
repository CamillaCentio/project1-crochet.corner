# Crochet Corner 
Crochet Corner is a website where we crocheters gather to crochet together. We offer meetings over Google Meet.

Users on the page will be able to find information about what we do and how, you will also find links to social media where there are more crocheters and also a link to a pattern library with free patterns. You can sign up for our newsletter where we will provide information about various meetings and also in the future that users themselves can set up a meeting where others can join, because not everyone can attend the already fixed times.

The website is aimed at crocheters who feel that it is a bit boring to sit at home all by themselves and crochet but may not have the opportunity to sit down in a cafe with others and crochet.
